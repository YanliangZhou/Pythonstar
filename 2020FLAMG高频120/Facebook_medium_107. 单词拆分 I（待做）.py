# Description
# Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be broken into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
# Because of we have used stronger data, the ordinary DFS method can not pass this question now.
#
# s.length <= 1e5
# dict.size <= 1e5
#
# Have you met this question in a real interview?
# Example
# Example 1:
# 	Input:  "lintcode", ["lint", "code"]
# 	Output:  true
#
# Example 2:
# 	Input: "a", ["a"]
